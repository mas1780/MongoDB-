After living few years in the United States, I decided to return to my home and to re-open the door to visitors, friends and whomever is interested in having a true, authentic stay in Florence. I offer a private room with a queen-size bed in a brand new apartment, 1° floor, with internet, full kitchen, private bathroom, very safe area, few minutes walk from Ponte Vecchio and piazzale Michelangelo. Within the block are cafès, wineries, pizzerias, restaurants and a huge supermarket. I love to take a stroll down the city, by the Arno river and come back to this peaceful area. There is also a bus stop to connect to the most important spots in Tuscany. The apartment is very easy to reach both from the airport and from the train station. I'll be willing to provide you with directions, in case you are interested.<br /><br />Please, don't hesitate to write me if you need further details.<br /><br /><br />Stanza privata con un letto qu |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/3223872/56ac24d6\_original.jpg](https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/3223872/56ac24d6_original.jpg)                      | 99235    | [https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/99235](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/99235)       | Lucia                 | 2010-03-26  | Florence, Toscana, Italy | I was born and raised in the beautiful Florence.

Circa l' 80 % degli abitanti di questa zona, sono Cittadini Italiani , solo il 20% circa sono turisti, a 200 metri, dopo le vecchie mura, nel pieno centro storico , il 90 % delle persone sono turisti e forse solo il 10 % residenti. Quindi qui si respira ancora l'aria della città dove vivono i residenti, ...anche i ristoranti della zona sono frequentati prevalentemente dai cittadini Italiani con ottima cucina e prezzi ragionevoli.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/258903/f52542da\_original.jpg](https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/258903/f52542da_original.jpg)                        | 202686   | [https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/202686](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/202686)     | Tarcisio              | 2010-08-16  | Florence, Toscana, Italy | Persona normale, disponibile, non stà a me giudicarmi, per quanto riguarda il lavoro degli affitti turistici, le recensioni dei miei clienti parlano da sole.

	"description" : "<b>The space</b><br />Welcome to my cozy place in Florence! After living few years in the United States, I decided to return to my home and to re-open the door to visitors, friends and whomever is interested in having a true, authentic stay in Florence. I offer a private room with a queen-size bed in a brand new apartment, 1° floor, with internet, full kitchen, private bathroom, very safe area, few minutes walk from Ponte Vecchio and piazzale Michelangelo. Within the block are cafès, wineries, pizzerias, restaurants and a huge supermarket. I love to take a stroll down the city, by the Arno river and come back to this peaceful area. There is also a bus stop to connect to the most important spots in Tuscany. The apartment is very easy to reach both from the airport and from the train station. I'll be willing to provide you with directions, in case you are interested.<br /><br />Please, don't hesitate to write me if you need further details.<br /><br /><br />Stanza privata con un letto qu",

## 5. find all of the places that have more than 2 beds in a neighborhood of your choice (referred to as neighbourhood_group_cleansed in the data file), ordered by review_scores_rating descending. only show the name, beds, city, review_scores_rating, and price. if you run out of memory for this query, try filtering review_scores_rating that aren't empty ($ne); and lastly, if there's still an issue, you can set the beds to match exactly 2

```bash
> let nbhd_5 = {
... $match: {"neighbourhood" : "Florence, FI, Italy"}
... };
> let bed5 = {
... $match: {"beds" : { $gt: 2}}
... };
> let theFields = {
... $project: {
... _id: 0,
... "name": 1,
... "beds": 1,
... "review_scores_rating": 1,
... "price": 1
... }, 
... };
> let orderQ5 = { 
... $sort : {
... "review_scores_rating": -1 }
... };
> db.listings.aggregate(nbhd_5, bed5, theFields, orderQ5);
```

I was not entirely sure on how to get the terminal to increase the number of results it displays. 


## 7. in a particular neighborhood_group_cleansed of your choosing again, find the average review_scores_rating per neighborhood, and only show the ones above a 95, sorted in descending order of rating

```bash

...                 _id: "$neighbourhood", 
...                 reviewAverage: {$avg: "$review_scores_rating"}}
... };
> let reviews7 = {
... $match: {
...         reviewAverage: {
...                 $gt: 95
...         }
...     }
... };
> let order7 = {
... $sort: { 
...                 reviewAverage: -1 }
... };
> db.listings.aggregate(nbhd_7, reviews7, order7);
```

## Problems with importing data listings.csv to i6 

I had trouble getting my data up to the server as I was using the mongoimport command from within the database rather than from the unix i6 server through my terminal. That took the most time to solve. 

In the queries, I had to make different varaibles to instruct the db on how to output the data and found examples online and from the notes to help me do it. 

I did not feel that the data I was working with needed any munging to complete the requirements of the workshop therefore I kept my data in it original form. 

Furthermore, I did not use the unzip command in my terminal. Instead, I unzipped the file on my desktop and uploaded a listing.csv data directly using cyberduck.
